                        <p>According to the NYPD, pickpocketing incidents increase during the months of August, September and October, obviously during the start of the school year. In the majority of the reported incidents, the victim had their wallet removed from their backpack front compartment, a common location where students put their wallets. Carry your bag in front of you. Gentlemen, carry your wallet in your front pocket.</p>
                        <h4>Common locations where thieves target victims:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>By the subway turnstiles – Thief one walks in front of you swiping their metro card but they use a card that denies them access while the second thief is behind you, bumps into you removing your property (cell phone, wallet, etc)</li>
                            <li>In a crowded train – removing your wallet from your backpack front compartment.</li>
                            <li>Going up or down the stairs of the subway – removing your property from your backpack front compartment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Pickpockets thieves look like you and I and usually work in a team of two or three.</p>

                        <h1>Identity Theft a Growing Epidemic</h1>
                        <p>Identity theft occurs when someone wrongfully uses your personal identification to obtain credit, loans, services, even rentals and mortgages in your name. Information can be stolen from a consumer in a variety of ways including: Going through your mail or trash to take pre-approved credit card offers, discarded receipts or other personal information; stealing your purse or wallet; calling you over the phone posing as a solicitor in order to gain personal information including date of birth and social security number or looking over your shoulder at an ATM while you are accessing your account, to steal your password, or pin.</p>
                        <p>Avoid becoming a victim: Order copies of your credit report from all 3 credit reporting agencies to get as much information as possible. Contact the credit reporting agencies in writing and let them know you are disputing inaccurate items in your credit report due to possible identity theft. Contact the credit card companies who are reporting the false debt and have them investigate possible identity theft. Keep all copies of all letters; document phone calls and request a letter from the agencies stating these items are under investigation. Do not carry important documents such as your social security card, birth certificate or passport unless absolutely necessary.</p>
                        <p>Only carry the credit cards in your purse or wallet that you need when shopping. Keep a list of your credit card account numbers, with expiration dates and telephone numbers for all your bank accounts and keep them in a safe location. In an emergency, you can notify these companies quickly to avoid fraudulent charges or purchases. Invest in a shredder and shred discarded papers with your information. Use a mix of letters and numbers when creating passwords.</p>
                        <h4>Here are some effective ways to combat Identity Theft:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Get a FREE annual credit report: www.annualcreditreport.com. Check and review your credit report. Report any discrepancies to the credit reporting agency. Put an alert on your credit if necessary.</li>
                            <li>Stop tele-marketing calls: www.donotcall.gov</li>
                            <li>Stop receiving unwanted catalogs and other telemarketing mail: www.dmachoice.org</li>
                            <li>Shred your old credit card, bank statements, bills, etc. to avoid dumpster diving. For more information on ID Theft or what to do if you are a victim, please go to www.ftc.gov</li>

                        <p>According to the New York City Police Department, the snatching of electronic devices is on the rise across the city and in many other large cities around the world. This is due to both the increased value and ubiquity of these devices.</p>
                        <p>A common element in these incidents is that the victims are not paying attention to their surroundings, distracted by the device in question. Quite often the perpetrator follows the victim from behind and snatches the electronic device right out of his or her hand. In a number of these incidents, the perpetrators were riding bicycles when they targeted their victim. These events are not limited to the streets and have also occurred on subways and buses. The NYPD & FBI are currently investigating fencing operations (stores) that are buying these stolen electronic devices.</p>
                        <h4>To avoid being a victim:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pay attention to your surroundings, minimize the amount of time you talk on your cell phone in public places.</li>
                            <li>If you suspect you are being followed, go into an open store or a Public Safety Safe Haven and have the clerk call the Police or Public Safety right-away.</li>
                            <li>Keep all electronic devices in an inside jacket pocket. Avoid clipping them onto outer garments or displaying them anywhere visible.</li>
                            <li>If your cell phone is stolen, call your carrier and report the theft. Request that an alert be placed on the phone, preventing its use.</li>
                            <li>Mark your device by engraving (Operation ID) or with invisible ink (Operation Blue Light). These programs are offered free of charge by Public Safety. For more Information, please call 854-8513.</li>

                            <li>Avoid standing at the end of subway platforms or on an empty platform. Instead, wait in the Off-Hours Waiting Area, particularly at night. Most stations have one, generally located on the mezzanine level, near a station booth. Speak to the station agent or other NYC Transit employees (who wear bright orange vests) if you have a problem. Use a Customer Assistance Intercom (mounted on a platform column) to get help in a station where you're not visible to the station agent. When you speak into the Customer Assistance Intercom, the agent can speak with you. You can also use a public phone on the mezzanine or platform to dial 911 (the police) if you need help. This call is free. Each station booth posts the district and phone number of the NYPD unit that patrols the station. When it's not an emergency, use this number to contact the police. Electronic signs in many Off-Hours Waiting Areas indicate when a train is approaching the station. If you wait near the sign, you will have enough time to walk to the platform as the train arrives.</li>
                            <li>During late hours it recommended to stay in the first or middle subway car where the conductor or the motor person has a radio to alert the police if necessary.</li>
                            <li>Use well-lighted, busy stops. If you must get off at a little-used stop, try to arrange for a friend or an adult to meet you.</li>
                            <li>Bus customers who travel between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. can Request-a-Stop. Ask the bus operator to let you off anywhere along the route, even if it isn't a designated stop. The bus operator will comply as long as he or she thinks it's a safe location. This bus will still make all regularly scheduled stops.</li>
                            <li>Watch who gets off your stop with you. If you feel uneasy, walk directly to a place where there are other people.</li>

View the Safe Haven Locations here. Ask the storeowner to call 911 or CU Public Safety. If you're being driven home, ask the driver to wait until you are safely inside.
